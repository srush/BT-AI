# # Lab 0

# As part of the summer session, we are going to each build an AI
# system. Our main focus will be on learning the core elements of data
# processing, machine learning, deep learning, and AI.


# ## Lab Schedule

# Each week for the next 8 weeks we will do a lab.  Labs are a
# combination of ML background and applications.

# Each person will work through their lab in a notebook with their
# group members.

# Planned Labs
#
# 1. Programming (Python)
# 2. Structured Data (Pandas)
# 3. Visualizing Data (Altair)
# 4. Machine Learning I (Scikit-Learn)
# 5. Machine Learning II (Scikit-Learn)
# 6. Deep Learning I (Keras)
# 7. Deep Learning II (Keras)
# 8. AI Applications (Keras)


# ## Lab Structure

# Each lab will last for 3 hours. It will be broken up into
# two parts with a 10 minute break in between. Each lab will
# end with a short feedback period at the end.

# During the lab there will be 2 group sessions where we will
# break into small groups. Groups will be randomly assigned each
# week through slack.


# ## Sample Lab

# * 4:00-4:10 - Icebreakers and Weekly Teams
# * 4:10-4:25 - Review
# * 4:25-4:30 - Self-Review Exercise
# * 4:30-5:00 - Unit A Walkthrough
# * 5:00-5:35 - Group Exercise A
# * 5:35-5:45 - Break
# * 5:45-6:15 - Unit B Walkthrough
# * 6:15-6:45 - Group Exercise B
# * 6:45-6:55 - Wrap-up
# * 6:55-7:00 - Class Survey


# ## Colab Notebooks

# For the course we will use a tool known as Colab notebooks.
# This is a special system developed by Google that is
# designed to be a professional AI development environment.


# To get started, you will need to follow these steps:

# 1. Be sure to have a Google account. If you use gmail
#    that should work to get started.
# 2. Navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/
# 3. Click "Examples -> Overview of Colab Features"


# The key takeaway from the Colab setup is that you can
# have both descriptive text and code in the same file.
# We will use this throughout the class for labs and homeworks.


# ## Homework

# Each lab will have two group activities. You will have time
# each week to work through these activities with your teammates.
# Any activities that you do not have a chance to complete will be that
# week's homework. It is due before the next week's class.
