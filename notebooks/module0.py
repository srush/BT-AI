# Lab 0

# As part of the summer session, we will build a machine
# learning system for an applied problem. Each person
# will work through their lab in a notebook with their group
# members. 


# ## Lab Schedule

# Each week for the next 8 weeks we will do a lab.  Labs are a
# combination of ML background and applications.


# Planned Labs
#
# 1) Programming (Python)
# 2) Structured Data (Pandas)
# 3) Visualizing Data (Altair)
# 4) Machine Learning I (Scikit-Learn)
# 5) Machine Learning II (Scikit-Learn)
# 6) Deep Learning I (Keras)
# 7) Deep Learning II (Keras)
# 8) AI Applications (Keras)



# ## Lab Structure

# Each lab will last for 3 hours. It will be broken up into
# two parts with a 10 minute break in between. Each lab will
# end with a short feedback period at the end. 

# During the lab there will be 2 group sessions where we will
# break into small groups. Groups will be randomly assigned each
# week.


# ## Sample Lab

# 4:05-4:15 - Icebreakers and Weekly Teams
# 4:15-4:25 - Review
# 4:25-4:30 - Self-Review Exercise
# 4:30-5:00 - Unit A Walkthrough
# 5:00-5:35 - Group Exercise A
# 5:35-5:45 - Break
# 5:45-6:15 - Unit B Walkthrough
# 6:15-6:45 - Group Exercise B
# 6:45-6:55 - Wrap-up
# 6:55-7:00 - Class Survey


# ## Colab Notebooks

# For the course we will use a tool known as Colab notebooks.
# This is a special system developed by Google that is
# designed to be a professional AI development environment.


# To get started, you will need to follow these steps:

# 1) Be sure to have a Google account. If you use gmail
#    that should work to get started.
# 2) Navigate to
